      <description>The Olympics have come to an end and what an incredible few weeks it has been. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved sports. I started playing football for my neighbourhood team—Yellowbird Soccer—when I was 7. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, we didn&amp;rsquo;t win too much, but some of my fondest memories growing up are with this team. My dad was one of the coaches, and I vividly remember how we used to go to the ground early, lugging a bag with around 15 footballs, carrying marking cones and snacks for the team in a portable freezer.</description>

      <description>Hello!insert drumroll, perhaps some applause
(Just kidding.)
I am so, so pumped to be writing the first blog for my website. Building something of my own has always been this huge goal of mine and to see thearvindas.me come to life is unreal to me.
The process started way back at the start of June. I started looking up static site generators and, needless to say, I was very flustered by the endless resources and results.</description>
