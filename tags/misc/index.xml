      <description>It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve documented my thoughts here. In the following read, you&amp;rsquo;ll find out why.
I&amp;rsquo;ve come back to Manipal for my sixth semester of college. We have switched back to a completely offline mode of learning. I do admit, I am incredibly sick of MS Teams, but wow, I had completely forgotten how tiring offline classes are. Running around from the hostels to the academic blocks, regular assignments and quizzes, hectic labs, and incoming exams — we truly are back.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve documented everything going on in my life here, so here goes. The start to 2022 has been very eventful so far and January has been a month of new learnings and experiences.
The biggest (and best) thing going on right now would have to be my internship at Zuperly . Working with this fantastic team has been an amazing journey so far. Here&amp;rsquo;s some of my highlights and takeaways from the ride so far:</description>

      <description>Very recently, I came across this tweet by Sahil Bloom. I was taken aback by the simplicity of the idea yet how much sense it made to me right away. Heading into the new year, figured that this was a framework I could try out.
What are a few things I never regret?
 I never regret waking up early. I never regret working out I never regret going out for a walk with a pair of earphones I never regret time spent with family and my best friends I never regret cutting down on screen times I never regret eating healthy I never regret spending time with my guitar I never regret time spent writing I never regret time spent learning and reading I never regret maintaining good posture  Just writing this down gives me a sense of why I should do these more.</description>

      <description>Since a lot of what I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote down in this blog is my attempt at getting an internship, it makes sense to have a post celebrating that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got one :D
Stoked to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined Zuperly as a Product intern! It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly 2 weeks since I&amp;rsquo;ve joined and I&amp;rsquo;ve had a fantastic experience so far. Huge huge thanks to the founder Kapil who&amp;rsquo;s made it so so easy for me to jump in on this and get started.</description>

A while ago, I stumbled across Aditya Mohanty&amp;rsquo;s blog and saw this — a collection of rules that he lives by. Being someone that loves defining every aspect of my life and committing to a certain standard of ethics, I decided to make a list of rules for myself as well.
To save your time, I&amp;rsquo;ve listed my rules first, the chit-chat comes later.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been an ardent fan of trusting the process. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get disheartened when things don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work out but it&amp;rsquo;s important to believe that everyone has a story, a process, a journey towards what they want to achieve — trust it and never stop the hard work.
Yesterday came the good news of me clearing Upraised&amp;rsquo;s internship program called Embark . I was selected as one of the top 50 in the Design track among a total of 4.</description>

      <description>I leave home for college tomorrow. Lots of emotions running around in my head. Thought I&amp;rsquo;d document a bit of it.
The pandemic changed the way college works. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time at home than in Manipal so far in my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s. The norm has shifted. Home is where I live, Manipal is the vacation. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult for my family to see me packing my bags and looking up flights online.</description>

      <title>hunting, shipwrecks, and a washed out Grand Prix</title>

      <description>Before I begin, here are a few things I&amp;rsquo;d like to clear up:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing that the titles of these blog posts have been increasing in length each time. Although I would like them all to be the same length simply for good visuals, I can&amp;rsquo;t find a way to keep them concise. Hence, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking at the list of posts and noticing the gradual increase, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s been bothering me too.</description>

      <description>The Olympics have come to an end and what an incredible few weeks it has been. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved sports. I started playing football for my neighbourhood team—Yellowbird Soccer—when I was 7. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, we didn&amp;rsquo;t win too much, but some of my fondest memories growing up are with this team. My dad was one of the coaches, and I vividly remember how we used to go to the ground early, lugging a bag with around 15 footballs, carrying marking cones and snacks for the team in a portable freezer.</description>

      <description>Hello!insert drumroll, perhaps some applause
(Just kidding.)
I am so, so pumped to be writing the first blog for my website. Building something of my own has always been this huge goal of mine and to see thearvindas.me come to life is unreal to me.
The process started way back at the start of June. I started looking up static site generators and, needless to say, I was very flustered by the endless resources and results.</description>
