      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going down for walks these days and have picked up a habit of listening to podcasts. Today I listened to this podcast by Rob Dial where he speaks about 6 habits to boost one&amp;rsquo;s productivity. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learnt:
Everyone has 24 hours in a day. The difference is in how these 24 hours are spent. To be productive is to maximize outcomes in the time we have — getting more things done in the same amount of time.</description>

      <description>Recently watched this video of Shreyas Doshi talking about his PM learnings over the years, and immediately knew I had to document it right away.
Here are my notes from the video:
Advice for aspiring PMs:
 Do the role before you get the job Your current company/work is the best place to start Build your own side project/product  The Law of PM Suitability: the traits required to break into the PM role are the very same traits that are prerequisites for succeeding as a PM</description>

      <description>At the start of 2021, I promised myself I&amp;rsquo;d do a few things for sure this year. Excited to tell y&amp;rsquo;all that I&amp;rsquo;ve ticked off a checkbox—sending a cold email. I was hesitant to apply for internships over the last few months due to a fear of a lack of knowledge. I can now tell you in all honesty that, that is time gone down the drain. No regrets because I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a lot, nevertheless.</description>

      <description>inconvenient truth about productsproduct discovery--The more I dive into learning and understanding product, the more I understand how important reading is. I&amp;rsquo;ve come across some incredible reads in the past week, some of which I&amp;rsquo;d like to put out here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve said incredible reads, I&amp;rsquo;m sure some of y&amp;rsquo;all must be thinking, &amp;ldquo;oh, Arvin read something by Marty Cagan &amp;rdquo;. Damn right you are.
This article titled The Inconvenient Truth About Product speaks about the unavoidable, annoying, yet very real truth about building product.</description>

      <description>One of the cool things I did this summer was stepping into design (properly). I&amp;rsquo;ve always been intrigued by good visuals — I&amp;rsquo;ve been making art ever since I was a kid. Starting off with crayons to learning watercolours to being formally trained as an artist to creating graphics and digital art at college, I&amp;rsquo;ve had quite the ride.
Taking the Google UX Design course was a great learning experience. Obviously, MOOCs aren&amp;rsquo;t the best way to upskill these days, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things I learnt, some which changed the way I think about products and their design.</description>
