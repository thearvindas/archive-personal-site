      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve documented everything going on in my life here, so here goes. The start to 2022 has been very eventful so far and January has been a month of new learnings and experiences.
The biggest (and best) thing going on right now would have to be my internship at Zuperly . Working with this fantastic team has been an amazing journey so far. Here&amp;rsquo;s some of my highlights and takeaways from the ride so far:</description>

      <description>Here are my notes/highlights/favourite parts from Hooked by Nir Eyal:
  Face it, we’re hooked. The technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions. It’s the impulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later. It’s the urge you likely feel throughout your day but hardly notice.</description>

      <description>Here are my notes/highlights/favourite parts from The Art of Saying No by Damon Zahariades:
  Saying no to people is one of the most important skills you can develop. It frees you to pursue your own interests, both personal and professional. To that end, it’ll boost your productivity, improve your relationships, and fill you with a sense of confident calm that may seem alien to you at this moment.</description>

      <description>These are my notes from Solving Product Design Exercises by Artiom Dashinsky .
approaching a product design exercise Whenever you encounter a problem, don&amp;rsquo;t immediately dive into it and start thinking of solutions. The single most important thing to remember while solving product design exercises is to follow a process. Here are three tips to help you solve a problem:
  Make sure you understand the task: understand the deliverables, mode of delivery, fidelity level required, and the mode of presentation</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going down for walks these days and have picked up a habit of listening to podcasts. Today I listened to this podcast by Rob Dial where he speaks about 6 habits to boost one&amp;rsquo;s productivity. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learnt:
Everyone has 24 hours in a day. The difference is in how these 24 hours are spent. To be productive is to maximize outcomes in the time we have — getting more things done in the same amount of time.</description>

      <description>Recently watched this video of Shreyas Doshi talking about his PM learnings over the years, and immediately knew I had to document it right away.
Here are my notes from the video:
Advice for aspiring PMs:
 Do the role before you get the job Your current company/work is the best place to start Build your own side project/product  The Law of PM Suitability: the traits required to break into the PM role are the very same traits that are prerequisites for succeeding as a PM</description>

      <description>At the start of 2021, I promised myself I&amp;rsquo;d do a few things for sure this year. Excited to tell y&amp;rsquo;all that I&amp;rsquo;ve ticked off a checkbox—sending a cold email. I was hesitant to apply for internships over the last few months due to a fear of a lack of knowledge. I can now tell you in all honesty that, that is time gone down the drain. No regrets because I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a lot, nevertheless.</description>

      <description>inconvenient truth about productsproduct discovery--The more I dive into learning and understanding product, the more I understand how important reading is. I&amp;rsquo;ve come across some incredible reads in the past week, some of which I&amp;rsquo;d like to put out here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve said incredible reads, I&amp;rsquo;m sure some of y&amp;rsquo;all must be thinking, &amp;ldquo;oh, Arvin read something by Marty Cagan &amp;rdquo;. Damn right you are.
This article titled The Inconvenient Truth About Product speaks about the unavoidable, annoying, yet very real truth about building product.</description>
