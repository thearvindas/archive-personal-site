      <description>One of the cool things I did this summer was stepping into design (properly). I&amp;rsquo;ve always been intrigued by good visuals — I&amp;rsquo;ve been making art ever since I was a kid. Starting off with crayons to learning watercolours to being formally trained as an artist to creating graphics and digital art at college, I&amp;rsquo;ve had quite the ride.
Taking the Google UX Design course was a great learning experience. Obviously, MOOCs aren&amp;rsquo;t the best way to upskill these days, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things I learnt, some which changed the way I think about products and their design.</description>
