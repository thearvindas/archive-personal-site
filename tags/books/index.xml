      <description>Here are my notes/highlights/favourite parts from Do Epic Shit by Ankur Warikoo:
  Nothing beats the feeling of having done more in twenty-four hours than what the day expected you to! That joy, that emotion, when you’ve exceeded your own self, is true achievement.
  Others’ success will generate massive self-doubt every morning when you get up. Get up anyway.
  A year from now, you will wish you had started today.</description>

      <description>Here are my notes/highlights/favourite parts from Hooked by Nir Eyal:
  Face it, we’re hooked. The technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions. It’s the impulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later. It’s the urge you likely feel throughout your day but hardly notice.</description>

      <description>Here are my notes/highlights/favourite parts from The Art of Saying No by Damon Zahariades:
  Saying no to people is one of the most important skills you can develop. It frees you to pursue your own interests, both personal and professional. To that end, it’ll boost your productivity, improve your relationships, and fill you with a sense of confident calm that may seem alien to you at this moment.</description>
