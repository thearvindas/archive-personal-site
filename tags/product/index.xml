      <description>At the start of 2021, I promised myself I&amp;rsquo;d do a few things for sure this year. Excited to tell y&amp;rsquo;all that I&amp;rsquo;ve ticked off a checkbox—sending a cold email. I was hesitant to apply for internships over the last few months due to a fear of a lack of knowledge. I can now tell you in all honesty that, that is time gone down the drain. No regrets because I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a lot, nevertheless.</description>

      <description>inconvenient truth about productsproduct discovery--The more I dive into learning and understanding product, the more I understand how important reading is. I&amp;rsquo;ve come across some incredible reads in the past week, some of which I&amp;rsquo;d like to put out here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve said incredible reads, I&amp;rsquo;m sure some of y&amp;rsquo;all must be thinking, &amp;ldquo;oh, Arvin read something by Marty Cagan &amp;rdquo;. Damn right you are.
This article titled The Inconvenient Truth About Product speaks about the unavoidable, annoying, yet very real truth about building product.</description>
