      <description>This list is a documentation of all the things that made me happy in 2022 — the small wins that keep me moving. This is not to show off but to bring a sense of gratitude in finding comfort in the smaller things. I have good days and I have bad days and on my bad days, there is comfort in knowing that this is something I can come to.</description>

      <title>rules, why I need them, and why I&#39;m writing them down [keeps updating]</title>

      <description>A while ago, I stumbled across Aditya Mohanty&amp;rsquo;s blog and saw this — a collection of rules that he lives by. Being someone that loves defining every aspect of my life and committing to a certain standard of ethics, I decided to make a list of rules for myself as well.
To save your time, I&amp;rsquo;ve listed my rules first, the chit-chat comes later.
