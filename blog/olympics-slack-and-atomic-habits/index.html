<p>The Olympics have come to an end and what an incredible few weeks it has been. I&rsquo;ve always loved sports. I started playing football for my neighbourhood team—Yellowbird Soccer—when I was 7. I&rsquo;ll be honest, we didn&rsquo;t win too much, but some of my fondest memories growing up are with this team. My dad was one of the coaches, and I vividly remember how we used to go to the ground early, lugging a bag with around 15 footballs, carrying marking cones and snacks for the team in a portable freezer.<br>
13 years later, I&rsquo;ve added sports like badminton, cricket and F1 to my list of favourites.
To be fair though, I&rsquo;ll watch any sport, given I can understand the rules from Google a few minutes before it starts.</p>
<p>The sweat, grit, and sheer passion that goes into sports is what makes it so brilliant to me. Watching the athletes fight it out and give it their all is so inspiring. India had an absolutely stellar run at these games; every single athlete killed it. What a privilege it&rsquo;s been to watch these men and women in action. It would be an understatement to say that I can&rsquo;t wait for Paris.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve joined a couple of product-related Slack communities. It&rsquo;s been a very humbling experience so far, I realize there&rsquo;s a lot to learn and a lot of competition. But more importantly, I&rsquo;ve learnt how powerful a community of passionate people can be. I&rsquo;ve been observing and reading a lot, these communities have really opened up the field for me. I feel only gratitude for initiatives like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long while since I&rsquo;ve read books. I decided to get back into it, particularly non-fiction. I picked up <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Atomic Habits</a>
. There&rsquo;s nothing I can say about this book that&rsquo;s not already been said. Every line is so powerful and striking. I&rsquo;ll end off with a quote from the book that was very eye-opening to me:</p>
<p><em>“When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”</em></p>
<p>Peace out.</p>
