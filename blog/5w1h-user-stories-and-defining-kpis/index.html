<p>Whenever you encounter a problem, don&rsquo;t immediately dive into it and start thinking of solutions. <em>The single most important thing to remember while solving product design exercises is to <strong>follow a process</strong>.</em> Here are three tips to help you solve a problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure you understand the task</strong>: understand the deliverables, mode of delivery, fidelity level required, and the mode of presentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask questions and make assumptions</strong>: get all the required information, understand the task and goal, why this product must exist, who you&rsquo;re building it for, and what problem it solves</p>
<p>Ask clarifying questions to better understand the goal. Even after all these questions, you may not have all the information you need — you&rsquo;ll have to make assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be critical about your solutions</strong>: always be prepared to reason out and justify your answers. You need to be aware of the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind your design decisions. Since it is difficult to come up with the most perfect solution, being able to think critically and iterate on your solution is important</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Solving a design exercise is basically designing a product in limited time and presenting your thinking process and the result. The <strong>5W1H approach</strong> is a good way of bringing structure to your answer.</p>
<p>5W1H is a series of 6 questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why</strong> am I building this?</li>
<li><strong>Who</strong> am I building it for?</li>
<li><strong>When</strong> are <strong>where</strong> will it be used?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> am I building?</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> could I measure it?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is also what the framework (coming up next) is based on.</p>
<h2 id="solving-a-product-design-exercise">solving a product design exercise<a class="anchor" href="#solving-a-product-design-exercise">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand your goal (Why)</strong><br>
The best way to start your solution is to define what you&rsquo;re aiming for and how it helps the business. Think of the following aspects if you are:<br>
• <strong>building a new product</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is this product important?</li>
<li>What problem are we trying to solve?</li>
<li>What impact does it have on the world?</li>
<li>How does this product benefit users?</li>
<li>What business opportunities does it create?</li>
</ul>
<p>• <strong>improving an existing product</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is this product important?</li>
<li>Why does it need improvement?</li>
<li>What are we trying to improve?</li>
<li>What impact does it have on the world?</li>
<li>What business opportunities does it create?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define the audience (Who)</strong><br>
The next step is to understand who you&rsquo;re building the product for. Paul Graham, the founder of YCombinator says that the #1 reason startups/products fail is because it&rsquo;s not something users want.</p>
<p>Choosing the audience is very important, especially the high-level types of audience — people who&rsquo;ll be your product&rsquo;s primary users, who&rsquo;ll shape and define your product.</p>
<p>Once you choose the high-level audience, try understanding them better by describing them. Some important factors that can be considered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>age</li>
<li>gender</li>
<li>location</li>
<li>occupation</li>
<li>mobility</li>
</ul>
<p>This is very important because a product is highly shaped by its users and their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand the customer&rsquo;s context and needs (When and Where)</strong><br>
Once the audience is defined, you need to identify when and where they experience a problem for which your product is a solution. Some questions that can be thought of:</p>
<ul>
<li>where are they physically?</li>
<li>what triggers the need for a solution?</li>
<li>how much time do they have?</li>
<li>what emotions do  they experience?</li>
</ul>
<p>Try understanding the users by mapping out user stories.<br>
<em>As a [user], I want [goal/desire] so that [benefit].</em></p>
<p>The problem can be further understood by mapping out the user journey and identifying pain points along the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>List ideas (What)</strong><br>
Now that you have an idea of the problem and the users, you can start thinking of possible solutions. These are some properties that can be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>type of product (digital/physical)</li>
<li>platform (smartphone, TV, laptop, etc.)</li>
<li>type of interface (screen, graphics, audio, VR, AR, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a template that can be used:<br>
<em>Build X for [Who/Step 2], that [When and Where/Step 3] to
[Why/Step 1]</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritize and choose an idea</strong><br>
Once you&rsquo;ve explored the different approaches to solving the problem, choose the idea you believe is optimal. There is no perfect solution, so you&rsquo;ll need to evaluate the upsides and downsides for all of them to evaluate the options.
Here are a few considerations that will help weigh up each idea:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>reach</strong>: how many customers would this solution reach and be able to help</li>
<li><strong>value</strong>: which solution provides the highest value to the users</li>
<li><strong>potential revenue</strong>: which solution meets the business goals of the company</li>
<li><strong>implementation effort</strong>: which solution is the most feasible for us to build</li>
</ul>
<p>Plotting an impact-effort matrix is another way of picking a solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>low impact + low effort: okay</li>
<li>low impact + high effort: bad</li>
<li>high impact + low effort: great</li>
<li>high impact + high effort: good</li>
</ul>
<p>Pick solutions that fall in the good/great region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solve</strong><br>
Now that the solution has been decided, we need to start figuring out implementation. This step includes a lot sketching — be it wireframes, user journeys, storyboarding, or any other ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Measure success</strong><br>
Coming up with a solution is no good if you don&rsquo;t know how to measure its impact/success. To measure success, we define <strong>Key Performance Indicators</strong> — quantifiable measures of performance over time for a specific objective. Some examples of metrics that could be measured:</p>
<ul>
<li>task success rate</li>
<li>task completion rate</li>
<li>engagement</li>
<li>retention</li>
<li>revenue</li>
<li>conversion</li>
<li>user acquisition</li>
<li>net promoter score (NPS)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
