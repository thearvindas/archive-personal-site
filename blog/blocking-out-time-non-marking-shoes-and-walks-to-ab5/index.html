<p>It has been a while since I&rsquo;ve documented my thoughts here. In the following read, you&rsquo;ll find out why.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come back to Manipal for my sixth semester of college. We have switched back to a completely offline mode of learning. I do admit, I am incredibly sick of MS Teams, but wow, I had completely forgotten how tiring offline classes are. Running around from the hostels to the academic blocks, regular assignments and quizzes, hectic labs, and incoming exams — we truly are back.</p>
<p>College work has consumed a lot of my time, so I have started a very intricate time management system where I document my entire day on <a href="https://cron.com/" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Cron</a>
. This is such a fantastic application, I&rsquo;m a huge fan (as of March 10th, I have 3 invites, <a href="https://twitter.com/thearvindas" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>DM me on Twitter</a>
 if you&rsquo;d like one =P). This has not only allowed me to plan out my days in advance but also make sure I have a good work-play balance. In case it wasn&rsquo;t clear already, I like being in <em>complete</em> control of everything.</p>
<p>My team at Zuperly has been incredibly understanding of my packed schedule, they still give me complete ownership and trust me to get my job done. So grateful for a culture like this. We&rsquo;ve been doing some fantastic stuff behind the scenes over the last couple months, so excited to see it all coming through.</p>
<p>A massive massive personal win I saw this month is getting back to sports =)) I&rsquo;ve always loved playing sports, mentioned a bit about it <a href="/blog/olympics-slack-and-atomic-habits/" 
  
  
>here</a>
 as well. But ever since I got arthritis, I&rsquo;ve been forced to be a little in and out of it. Haven&rsquo;t been able to play football like I used to. I think about this a lot and sometimes, it is quite disappointing because I love the game so much. Since I&rsquo;ve been feeling quite fit as of late, decided to take up playing badminton, and oh boy, do I love it. I started playing on the weekends with my friends back in Hyderabad and had too much fun. Realized I <em>really</em> need to keep playing once I&rsquo;m in Manipal. But then kicked in the fear of being the worst player on court, wondering what people think of my game, not being able to perform in public. These were the thoughts in my head for the first few days, but finally decided to take that leap. Got a membership at the court, got some gear, and have started playing =))</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Time goes away and leaves us with only one of these two things: regret or results.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Apart from all this, I really don&rsquo;t know what else. I&rsquo;ve been constantly busy, constantly doing something. I don&rsquo;t mind it too much, though. Times like this when I&rsquo;m writing stuff down is when I take a breather. Life is back with its fast and hectic monotony, but ain&rsquo;t nothing we can&rsquo;t get through. We move =)</p>
<p>Peace out.</p>
