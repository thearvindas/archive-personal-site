><strong>The Bitcoin Standard</strong></a>
 by Prof Saifedean Ammous.</em></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> to understand how Bitcoin works, one must first understand the how, why, and what of money. This blog has no mention of crypto. Just letting you know.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>The concept of money goes way back, all the way to 6000 BC. Needless to say, it didn&rsquo;t exist in the notes and coins form that we know and use today. Back then, the simplest way for people to exchange value was by exchanging goods with each other. This was called the <strong>barter system</strong>. If you wanted to buy tea, you could exchange an equivalent amount of say, salt. If you wanted new shoes, you could give clothes in exchange. It was easy and instant.
But flawless? Not quite.</p>
<p>What if your tea-seller didn&rsquo;t want salt? Or anything else that you had to offer? Think about a huge economy with lots of people and an even larger amount of goods that can be exchanged. The barter system works well in small societies with a steady number of goods. In larger societies, as scale increases, the problem of the <strong>Coincidence of Wants</strong> increases exponentially — you being ready to buy, but the seller not wanting what you have to offer.</p>
<p>There are three dimensions to the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Coincidence of Scales</strong>: what you want may not be equal in value to what you have to sell and dividing your good into smaller bits isn&rsquo;t an option, i.e., there is a difference in the <em>scale</em> of the goods. No one will sell, and definitely not break down their house in exchange for bananas.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Coincidence in Time Frames</strong>: each good has a value associated with time. A fair exchange is one where both the goods have a similar time value. At this moment, giving salt in exchange for an orange might sound alright, but think ahead. A week down the line, your oranges have gone bad, but the salt that is no longer yours is in perfectly usable condition.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Coincidence of Locations</strong>: certain goods have location constraints. Say you want to exchange your house for another. Unlike a bag of sugar, it is difficult to pick your house up, deliver it to the seller, and bring back theirs in exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three problems made direct exchange impractical. Hence, came the need for <strong>indirect exchange</strong>. In this form of exchange, people don&rsquo;t intend on using the goods they receive for themselves, but instead, plan on trading them away for something else in the near future. These goods are intermediary — they only serve as a medium of exchange. This method fixed some of the problems we faced with the barter system, but it still was inconvenient to have multiple intermediary goods. This led to the need for multiple exchanges hence, increasing the time it took to find the good that one needed in the first place.</p>
<p>Naturally, a far more efficient solution emerged — a single medium of exchange, accepted by everyone, aka, <strong>money</strong>. You&rsquo;ve probably heard the textbook definition of money countless times: <em>money is a medium of exchange</em>. People have money not for consumption or usage, but to <em>exchange</em> it for goods or services that they want.</p>
<p><em>In addition to being a medium of exchange, it is crucial that it holds value into the future</em>. Something is of value in the future only if its supply doesn&rsquo;t increase drastically today. In other words, you can determine if something is a good store of value if you know that its supply can&rsquo;t skyrocket without insane effort. Money whose supply is hard to increase is called <strong>hard money</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>hardness</em> of money can be understood using two quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li>stock: existing supply + everything that has been produced in the past</li>
<li>flow: extra production that will be made in the next time period</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Higher the stock-to-flow ratio, the more likely it is to maintain value over time.</em>
This leads to an interesting idea — money that is scarce holds more value.</p>
<p>Further, wide acceptance of a medium of exchange allows everything to be expressed in its terms, i.e., the amount of money allocated to something defines its presence, ability to be bought, sold, and compared. In even simpler terms, I can say one bag of chips is <em>cheaper</em> than the other because both of them are defined by the same medium of exchange, aka, the same <strong>unit of account</strong>.</p>
<p>To sum up, we&rsquo;ve come a long way since the barter system — money is evolving every single day, but if you break it down, at its core, money has three functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>it serves as a medium of exchange</li>
<li>it holds a time value</li>
<li>it is a unit of account</li>
</ul>
<p>Peace out.</p>
