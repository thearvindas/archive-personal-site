<p>I leave home for college tomorrow. Lots of emotions running around in my head. Thought I&rsquo;d document a bit of it.</p>
<p>The pandemic changed the way college works. I&rsquo;ve spent more time at home than in Manipal so far in my Bachelor&rsquo;s. The norm has shifted. Home is where I live, Manipal is the vacation. It&rsquo;s difficult for my family to see me packing my bags and looking up flights online. The pandemic has been terrible — but staying together at home has definitely made my family closer.</p>
<p>I leave home within a few hours. I should probably be asleep — I need to leave at 3 am. But I can&rsquo;t help but think of the last few moments.</p>
<p>Ma refuses to let the tears come out — she&rsquo;s more busy making sure everything is packed. She promises to make something for me to eat in the morning. She asks me to take two jackets because what if the other one gets wet.</p>
<p>Papa takes out his camera and sits us down in the living room. He clicks away pictures of these farewell moments. He grins when he compares the pictures on the DSLR with that of the OnePlus and sees not much difference. He goes to sleep early — he&rsquo;s had a very long day.</p>
<p>Dadu tells me a story — when he saw Papa leave home for college, technology wasn&rsquo;t where it is today. Dadu speaks about how he used to patiently wait, with a heavy heart, for a letter to come — news from Papa. He knew not where Papa would reach and what he would achieve. The only thing he could give Papa was his trust knowing that his boy would make him proud someday. Took a lot of patience, he tells me. Now, Dadu looks at his phone and smiles. &ldquo;Call me sometimes.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>My sister stuffs a teddy bear from my childhood into the suitcase. Don&rsquo;t take him out, she tells me. She hugs me before heading off to study. Not much has to be said. We&rsquo;re always there for each other.</p>
<p>Now, I sit on my bed, writing this down. It&rsquo;s moments like this that keep me going. I&rsquo;m reminded of the question: <em>who are you doing this for?</em> Needless to say, I know my answer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that I need to do. Not just for myself, but for my folks at home. Constant, endless support every single day. I want to give back now. Lots of dreams and things I want to achieve for them. This is what drives me.</p>
<p>Miles to go before I sleep.<br>
I&rsquo;ll see you from Manipal.</p>
<p>Peace out.</p>
