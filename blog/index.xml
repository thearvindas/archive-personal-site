      <description>One of the cool things I did this summer was stepping into design (properly). I&amp;rsquo;ve always been intrigued by good visuals — I&amp;rsquo;ve been making art ever since I was a kid. Starting off with crayons to learning watercolours to being formally trained as an artist to creating graphics and digital art at college, I&amp;rsquo;ve had quite the ride.
Taking the Google UX Design course was a great learning experience. Obviously, MOOCs aren&amp;rsquo;t the best way to upskill these days, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things I learnt, some which changed the way I think about products and their design.</description>

      <description>The Olympics have come to an end and what an incredible few weeks it has been. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved sports. I started playing football for my neighbourhood team—Yellowbird Soccer—when I was 7. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, we didn&amp;rsquo;t win too much, but some of my fondest memories growing up are with this team. My dad was one of the coaches, and I vividly remember how we used to go to the ground early, lugging a bag with around 15 footballs, carrying marking cones and snacks for the team in a portable freezer.</description>

      <description>Hello!insert drumroll, perhaps some applause
(Just kidding.)
I am so, so pumped to be writing the first blog for my website. Building something of my own has always been this huge goal of mine and to see thearvindas.me come to life is unreal to me.
The process started way back at the start of June. I started looking up static site generators and, needless to say, I was very flustered by the endless resources and results.</description>
