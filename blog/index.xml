This list is a documentation of all the things that made me happy in 2022 — the small wins that keep me moving. This is not to show off but to bring a sense of gratitude in finding comfort in the smaller things. I have good days and I have bad days and on my bad days, there is comfort in knowing that this is something I can come to.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve documented everything going on in my life here, so here goes. The start to 2022 has been very eventful so far and January has been a month of new learnings and experiences.
The biggest (and best) thing going on right now would have to be my internship at Zuperly . Working with this fantastic team has been an amazing journey so far. Here&amp;rsquo;s some of my highlights and takeaways from the ride so far:</description>

      <description>Here are my notes/highlights/favourite parts from Hooked by Nir Eyal:
  Face it, we’re hooked. The technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions. It’s the impulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later. It’s the urge you likely feel throughout your day but hardly notice.</description>

      <description>Here are my notes/highlights/favourite parts from The Art of Saying No by Damon Zahariades:
  Saying no to people is one of the most important skills you can develop. It frees you to pursue your own interests, both personal and professional. To that end, it’ll boost your productivity, improve your relationships, and fill you with a sense of confident calm that may seem alien to you at this moment.</description>

      <description>Very recently, I came across this tweet by Sahil Bloom. I was taken aback by the simplicity of the idea yet how much sense it made to me right away. Heading into the new year, figured that this was a framework I could try out.
What are a few things I never regret?
 I never regret waking up early. I never regret working out I never regret going out for a walk with a pair of earphones I never regret time spent with family and my best friends I never regret cutting down on screen times I never regret eating healthy I never regret spending time with my guitar I never regret time spent writing I never regret time spent learning and reading I never regret maintaining good posture  Just writing this down gives me a sense of why I should do these more.</description>

      <description>Since a lot of what I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote down in this blog is my attempt at getting an internship, it makes sense to have a post celebrating that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got one :D
Stoked to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined Zuperly as a Product intern! It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly 2 weeks since I&amp;rsquo;ve joined and I&amp;rsquo;ve had a fantastic experience so far. Huge huge thanks to the founder Kapil who&amp;rsquo;s made it so so easy for me to jump in on this and get started.</description>

A while ago, I stumbled across Aditya Mohanty&amp;rsquo;s blog and saw this — a collection of rules that he lives by. Being someone that loves defining every aspect of my life and committing to a certain standard of ethics, I decided to make a list of rules for myself as well.
To save your time, I&amp;rsquo;ve listed my rules first, the chit-chat comes later.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been an ardent fan of trusting the process. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get disheartened when things don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work out but it&amp;rsquo;s important to believe that everyone has a story, a process, a journey towards what they want to achieve — trust it and never stop the hard work.
Yesterday came the good news of me clearing Upraised&amp;rsquo;s internship program called Embark . I was selected as one of the top 50 in the Design track among a total of 4.</description>

      <description>These are my notes from Solving Product Design Exercises by Artiom Dashinsky .
approaching a product design exercise Whenever you encounter a problem, don&amp;rsquo;t immediately dive into it and start thinking of solutions. The single most important thing to remember while solving product design exercises is to follow a process. Here are three tips to help you solve a problem:
  Make sure you understand the task: understand the deliverables, mode of delivery, fidelity level required, and the mode of presentation</description>

      <description>I leave home for college tomorrow. Lots of emotions running around in my head. Thought I&amp;rsquo;d document a bit of it.
The pandemic changed the way college works. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time at home than in Manipal so far in my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s. The norm has shifted. Home is where I live, Manipal is the vacation. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult for my family to see me packing my bags and looking up flights online.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going down for walks these days and have picked up a habit of listening to podcasts. Today I listened to this podcast by Rob Dial where he speaks about 6 habits to boost one&amp;rsquo;s productivity. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learnt:
Everyone has 24 hours in a day. The difference is in how these 24 hours are spent. To be productive is to maximize outcomes in the time we have — getting more things done in the same amount of time.</description>

      <description>Recently watched this video of Shreyas Doshi talking about his PM learnings over the years, and immediately knew I had to document it right away.
Here are my notes from the video:
Advice for aspiring PMs:
 Do the role before you get the job Your current company/work is the best place to start Build your own side project/product  The Law of PM Suitability: the traits required to break into the PM role are the very same traits that are prerequisites for succeeding as a PM</description>

      <description>Before I begin, here are a few things I&amp;rsquo;d like to clear up:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing that the titles of these blog posts have been increasing in length each time. Although I would like them all to be the same length simply for good visuals, I can&amp;rsquo;t find a way to keep them concise. Hence, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking at the list of posts and noticing the gradual increase, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s been bothering me too.</description>

      <description>At the start of 2021, I promised myself I&amp;rsquo;d do a few things for sure this year. Excited to tell y&amp;rsquo;all that I&amp;rsquo;ve ticked off a checkbox—sending a cold email. I was hesitant to apply for internships over the last few months due to a fear of a lack of knowledge. I can now tell you in all honesty that, that is time gone down the drain. No regrets because I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a lot, nevertheless.</description>

      <description>inconvenient truth about productsproduct discovery--The more I dive into learning and understanding product, the more I understand how important reading is. I&amp;rsquo;ve come across some incredible reads in the past week, some of which I&amp;rsquo;d like to put out here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve said incredible reads, I&amp;rsquo;m sure some of y&amp;rsquo;all must be thinking, &amp;ldquo;oh, Arvin read something by Marty Cagan &amp;rdquo;. Damn right you are.
This article titled The Inconvenient Truth About Product speaks about the unavoidable, annoying, yet very real truth about building product.</description>

      <description>The Olympics have come to an end and what an incredible few weeks it has been. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved sports. I started playing football for my neighbourhood team—Yellowbird Soccer—when I was 7. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, we didn&amp;rsquo;t win too much, but some of my fondest memories growing up are with this team. My dad was one of the coaches, and I vividly remember how we used to go to the ground early, lugging a bag with around 15 footballs, carrying marking cones and snacks for the team in a portable freezer.</description>

      <description>Hello!insert drumroll, perhaps some applause
(Just kidding.)
I am so, so pumped to be writing the first blog for my website. Building something of my own has always been this huge goal of mine and to see thearvindas.me come to life is unreal to me.
The process started way back at the start of June. I started looking up static site generators and, needless to say, I was very flustered by the endless resources and results.</description>
