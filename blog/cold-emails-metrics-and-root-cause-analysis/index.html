<p>At the start of 2021, I promised myself I&rsquo;d do a few things for sure this year. Excited to tell y&rsquo;all that I&rsquo;ve ticked off a checkbox—sending a cold email. I was hesitant to apply for internships over the last few months due to a fear of a lack of knowledge. I can now tell you in all honesty that, that is time gone down the drain. No regrets because I&rsquo;ve learnt a lot, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Sent a couple of cold emails this week, it was a really interesting experience. The most enjoyable part for me, so far, was writing a compelling subject line. Another thing I learnt along the process is that sometimes we get too worried about the outcome—what&rsquo;s most important is to make progress.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, I attended a talk on Product Metrics by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moinakb/" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Moinak Bandyopadhyay</a>
 as a part of <a href="https://www.theproductfolks.com/insurjo-product-management-program" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Insurjo</a>
 by The Product Folks. Let me tell you that it was some of the most enriching couple of hours I&rsquo;ve had in a while. Moinak sir is a god with product metrics. I learnt a lot of interesting things: the power of analytics, activation, retention, defining the North Star, and product-market fit, to list a few. I&rsquo;ve always loved looking at data and capturing insights, so this talk really got me a lot more intrigued.
(I remember the first time I saw insights about the music I listened to on Wynk in 2019. <em>Before you ask, yes, I&rsquo;ve shifted to Spotify</em>. Those insights blew my mind, I never realized companies stored that data and could show it to you in such interesting fashion.)
Realizing that analytics is a must-have skill for product management, I&rsquo;ve started learning how to work with Mixpanel with the help of <a href="https://productschool.teachable.com/p/productanalytics" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>this</a>
 course by Product School.</p>
<p>Another nice habit(?) I picked up, as of late, is binging PM interview videos on YouTube. I absolutely love the content <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ExponentTV" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Exponent</a>
 puts up. I&rsquo;ve been watching a lot of the problem-solving interviews, and I&rsquo;ve understood how one can find the root cause of a problem. Let me try explaining.</p>
<p>Consider the problem statement: <em>Netflix is seeing a drop in DAU, how would you assess the situation?</em><br>
Here&rsquo;s how we can approach this:
Root cause can be identified only when we look into all the factors that might have been involved. A systematic way to go about this would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with <em>technical challenges</em>: have we seen this drop post a new update, is there a bug, is there some issue with the metrics we are receiving</li>
<li>Next comes <em>user behaviour analysis</em>: is the drop in new or old users, is there a trend among a specific segment of users</li>
<li>Third, <em>sentimental analysis</em>: has there been negative PR about Netflix, have we put up content that can be off-putting to users, hence leading to drop, have we had any issues with customer care</li>
<li>Fourth, <em>demographic analysis</em>: is this drop happening in a particular location, particular age group</li>
<li>Lastly, <em>competitor analysis</em>: has the competition recently put out a new feature that might have pulled our user base, have they made their service cheaper, do they have content that we are lacking on</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering I&rsquo;ve sent a few cold emails, I hope these learnings come useful if I can land any interviews.</p>
<p>Peace out.</p>
