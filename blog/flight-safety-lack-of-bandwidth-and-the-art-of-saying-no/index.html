>The Art of Saying No</a>
 by Damon Zahariades:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Saying no to people is one of the most important skills you can develop. It frees you to pursue your own interests, both personal and professional. To that end, it’ll boost your productivity, improve your relationships, and fill you with a sense of confident calm that may seem alien to you at this moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you possess the ability to say no with confidence and grace, and do so with regularity, you’ll notice changes in how others perceive you. They’ll have more respect for you; they’ll place a greater value on your time; and they’ll come to see you as a leader rather than a follower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most people act out of self-interest; they naturally put their own priorities ahead of others’ priorities. But it means each of us is responsible for making sure our personal needs are met. No one is going to do it for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing your needs to remain unaddressed while you continuously cater to others is the path toward resentment and bitterness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider how flight attendants explain airline safety to passengers. In the event the cabin decompresses, you’re supposed to put on your oxygen mask before helping others put on their masks. Help yourself first. Then, assist others. These instructions aren’t intended to promote self-preservation. Rather, the airline knows that if you help others first, you risk succumbing to hypoxia. And that would prevent you from helping anyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being assertive means having the self-confidence to express your needs and wants, and pursue your own ends, even in the face of opposition. It involves telling people where you stand on a given topic and leaving no room for confusion. Assertiveness is declaring your point of view and not feeling as if you need others’ approval or validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s (refers to &ldquo;no&rdquo;) one of the smallest words in the English language. Yet, many of us believe it carries such awesome power that we’re afraid to say it. In those instances when we do manage to say no, we instinctively downplay our intentions, offering excuses and apologies to the requestor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of us were raised to believe that saying no is rude and egocentric. This belief becomes a significant part of our value system. So we spend our childhoods and much of our adult lives trying to live in a way that reflects an image we consider more honorable and respectable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I realized that as long as I was respectful to the individual asking for my help, I wasn’t responsible for any offense taken when I said no. This was a liberating feeling! It freed me from my fears of turning down requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a limited number of hours to play with each day. That means every time we say yes to someone, we’re saying no to someone or something else. And every time we say no, we free ourselves to spend that time and attention on another person or interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-care isn’t selfish. It’s necessary. The problem is, if you’re constantly saying yes to other people, putting their priorities ahead of your own, you won’t have the time or energy to care for yourself. And you’ll slowly become irritated, cynical, and miserable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think back to the last time you helped someone. I’ll bet it felt good. Your actions or advice improved that person’s day, which was probably a fantastic feeling. That’s why many of us love to help people. Knowing that we’ve contributed to someone else’s happiness is its own heady reward. In fact, it can be addictive. Some of us look for ways to help others, even if doing so means ignoring our own needs and responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will always be someone who could benefit from your attention. There will always be people who will gladly accept your help if you offer it. But keep in mind, you’re not responsible for solving other people’s problems. You’re responsible for yourself and those who depend on you (e.g. your immediate family).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The good news is that saying no can actually improve your sense of self-worth. The more you do it, the more you’ll come to realize that your time, commitments, and aspirations are just as important as those of the requestor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many folks have difficulty saying no because they struggle with conflict anxiety. They loathe confrontation, and will do just about anything to avoid it. For them, saying yes is a quick and easy way to quash a potential dust-up. The problem is, capitulating to avoid conflict reinforces the idea that your feelings are less important than those of the other person. The reality is, they’re not less important. You’re just being made to feel that way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re afraid of conflict, there are small, simple things you can do to overcome that fear. First, recognize that harmony isn’t always possible. People have conflicting opinions, needs, and desires. Friction is inevitable. Second, remind yourself that conflict isn’t necessarily bad. It’s merely the expression of contradictory views. How a person reacts to a conflict (with a calm demeanor or with anger) is an entirely different matter. Third, practice saying no in small steps. Start with situations where confrontations are likely to be nonexistent. An example is telling a salesperson at a clothing store that you don’t want to buy an article of clothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key, as always, is to take small steps. For example, in the beginning, just focus on not saying yes immediately. Give yourself a few moments to consider requests and how they’ll impact your day. Interrupting your instinctive response will help to short circuit the habit. Next, examine the reasons you’re inclined to say yes. Are those reasons valid? For example, do you desire the requestor’s approval? Do you need that person to validate your sense of worth? Is it important to you that you’re included in his or her circle of friends? You may find that this learned behavior (i.e. automatically saying yes) is prompted by motivations that are trivial to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s always better to be clear when you decline requests. Don’t beat around the bush. Don’t equivocate, hoping that it’ll pacify the requestor (it won’t). Instead, be candid about your unwillingness to consent to their request. Being straightforward when turning down requests doesn’t mean you’re being discourteous. In fact, your candidness is likely to be appreciated by the requestor, who’ll know that trying to persuade your accommodation will be a waste of time. The individual can spend that time more wisely looking elsewhere for assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When someone asks you for help, and you know you must turn down the request, don’t stall. Be direct and clear. Doing so may feel uncomfortable. It may even prompt the requestor to respond in anger. But you can’t control their response nor the emotions behind it. Being sincere with a direct &ldquo;no&rdquo; shows respect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The good news is that it’s possible to decline requests without saying the word “no.” It’s just a matter of finding different ways to communicate the same message. For example, suppose a family member asks you to take him to the airport. You could simply say no and provide a sincere reason. If he’s sympathetic to your circumstances, that should suffice. But let’s say you know from past experience that he’s not sympathetic. He’s inclined to hear “no” as a personal rejection, and likely to be angered by it. To avoid this reaction, how else might you decline his request?</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;I can’t commit to that right now because I’m focused on a high-priority project.&quot;</em>
This response tells the family member that you’re busy and unable to break away from your work.</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;I’d like to help you, but I’m swamped with this project right now.&quot;</em>
This response lets the family member know that he’s important to you, but there’s a valid reason you’re unable to accommodate him.</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;People are depending on me to finish this project. If I abandon it to help you, I’d be letting them down.&quot;</em>
This response explains that you’re forced to decline the request because of a prior commitment. Most people would hesitate before asking you to desert your obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how none of the above examples use the word &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It’s a difficult word to say because it’s a difficult word to hear. Turning down requests in ways that allow you to avoid saying no outright can help soften the blow. That can defuse any potential confrontation with the requestor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you must turn down a request or invitation, express your decision as a personal choice. Instead of telling the requestor, &ldquo;I can’t,&rdquo; tell them: &ldquo;I don’t want to.&rdquo; Give a reason if you suspect doing so will defuse a potentially combative response. (Make sure your reason is sincere and not simply an excuse.) The important thing is that you own your decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you say no, give the requestor another option. It’ll go a long way toward mitigating his or her disappointment at your inability or unwillingness to lend a hand. Keep in mind, you don’t owe the requestor alternatives. It’s just an act of goodwill. Nothing more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By describing your lack of bandwidth in detail, you’re letting the requestor know that you have other responsibilities. Abandoning these responsibilities isn’t an option for you. Meanwhile, the requestor doesn’t feel as if you’re rejecting them. On the contrary, it becomes clear that you sincerely are unavailable to lend a hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll inevitably encounter people who will refuse to take no for an answer. They’ll persist when you turn down their requests. They’ll attempt to cajole you into accepting their invitations. They might use emotional manipulation or even outright intimidation to compel you to accommodate them. First, realize that you can’t control how others behave. If someone persists after you’ve turned them down, remind yourself that the individual’s persistence has nothing to do with the validity of your choices. Some people are simply pushy. Second, the moment you second guess your decision, a pushy requestor is likely to notice and become more persistent. They will see an opening and be inclined to take advantage of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being courteous shows that you’re in control of yourself. You’re not prone to enraged outbursts. Instead, you maintain a businesslike professionalism that’s difficult to fault.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take stock of whether the fear of missing out is spurring you to say yes when you’re better off saying no. If it is, you must train yourself to control it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next time you instinctively want to say yes to an offer, request, or invitation, stop. Take a moment to think it through. Are you willing to say yes because there’s a high likelihood that doing so will pay dividends? Or are you saying yes simply because you fear missing out on an opportunity?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Peace out.</p>
