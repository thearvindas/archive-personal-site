>Do Epic Shit</a>
 by Ankur Warikoo:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nothing beats the feeling of having done more in twenty-four hours than what the day expected you to!
That joy, that emotion, when you’ve exceeded your own self, is true achievement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others’ success will generate massive self-doubt every morning when you get up. Get up anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year from now, you will wish you had started today. Start today. Time goes away and leaves us with only one of these two things: regret or results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How we think of our problems is how the world will think of our problems. If we exaggerate our problems, so will the world. If we are happy despite our problems, the world will help us get happier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The biggest misconception people have is that they are the odd one out and everyone else is sorted!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are what you do. Not what you say you’ll do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commitments are nothing if not backed up with actions. Luck happens to those that make things happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persistence isn’t a one-day miracle. It is a conscious choice translated into habit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistency + Authenticity is the magic formula to crack the content game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world will constantly be defining success and failure for you. Realizing this is what is called self-awareness. The truth is, your current rules of success and failure have been written by the world. Go ahead and rewrite them. For yourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are unhappy with where you are in life right now, do not wait to find out what you should be doing. Move out of where you are in life!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pro is the amateur who simply showed up every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one is born a pro. The pro is the amateur who put in their reps. The pro is the amateur who fell in love with the process. The pro is the amateur who chose practice and sleep over binge-watching. The pro is the amateur who worked hard even when they had zero audience. The pro is the amateur who persisted even when nothing seemed like it was working. The pro is the amateur who refused to be called an amateur. And chose to let their hard work do the talking. The pro is the one who chose discipline. Over excuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most sports are not played on the field. They are played in the mind!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ego is a bubble. Instead of bursting it and seeing what all lies outside, we invest most of our energy protecting it. To know what you don’t know is power. To ask and learn what you don’t know is a superpower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘It is not my job’ = death for a startup = survival for a large company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t find your passion. You grow your passion! Passion is not something that makes you M.F. Hussain or A.R. Rahman or Sachin Tendulkar on Day 1. Passion is that tiny inner nudge to paint, compose music or play cricket – the nudge that refuses to leave you, till the time you nurture it daily. Passion is persistence, because that is the reason you are still in it despite all the reasons to quit. Passion is showing up to do the work, no matter how good you’re at it already. Passion is signing up for hard work, because not choosing it would be harder!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decisions about money are best made through an Excel sheet. The decisions about people are best made with your heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you succeed, people see only success. If you fail, they see only failure. They don’t see the journey. Only you do. It is on this journey that your life was lived!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you often worry about what people will think of you, you will often end up doing what people want you to do. If you worry that people won’t like your decisions, you will make decisions that would please them. If you do not care about people’s opinions, you would finally do what you want to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 relationships that define almost everything that happens to us in our lives.</p>
<ul>
<li>The relationship we have with money.</li>
<li>The relationship we have with time.</li>
<li>The relationship we have with ourselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fighting the stereotype is a great way to get attention! If you send a résumé that is not ‘how your résumé must be’ but rather ‘how you are’, most companies would react in two ways:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They’d either hate it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or they’d remember you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is temporary discomfort in doing the unconventional. There is permanent discomfort in living life as a template.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your goal is to make people say: ‘I am not sure if she knows how to do it. But I am certain if told to do it, she will definitely figure it out. I trust her.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not the privilege that harms us. It is our lack of awareness of our own privilege that harms us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An excuse is the distance between who you are and who you wish to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one owes you their time and money. You earn it, every day, by the work you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don’t ask, the answer is always no.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today I know, the 20s should be used to discover yourself, as against stabilizing yourself. Meet as many people as you can, do as many jobs as you can, explore as many streams as you can. Find out what you are good at and what makes you happy. And then spend your 30s doing that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love habits, because the kind of person I become pursuing them opens up multiple doors, instead of chasing goals that may (perhaps) lead to just one door if one gets lucky. Habits build us, goals lay us barren.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trick to waking up early is not waking up early. It is sleeping on time!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curiosity has created more opportunities than hard work ever will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t try to minimize your struggle. Try to make it more meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three things that will tell you who/what you consider as important in your life.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your first hour after you wake up</li>
<li>Your last hour before you sleep</li>
<li>Your calendar</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know others through their actions. We know ourselves through our thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of your presence is way more important than the forced quantity of your attendance when you’re not present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who you spend time with will define the stories you hear. The stories you hear will define the stories in your head. The stories in your head will define you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The things that are the easiest to do are the things that are the hardest to live with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying no to everything else and sleeping on time – is the greatest secret sauce of self-love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you follow the right set of people on social media, opportunities will come by design. Not by luck! You become like the people you spend your time with – online and offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not underestimate your surroundings while trying to create flow!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If everyone did it, it wouldn’t need to be said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emotional debt has killed more people than financial debt ever will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being calm is a skill. Being calm when you are ridiculed. Being calm when you are left alone. Being calm when you are questioned. Not because they were right. Perhaps they were. Perhaps they were not. Because, if you lose your calm, you compound the unpleasant further instead of correcting it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fear has led to more procrastination than laziness ever will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe satisfaction is the most powerful skill to have. Satisfaction in your journey. Satisfaction in how far you’ve come. Satisfaction in all the unwanted parts of you you’ve scooped out. Satisfaction in your satisfaction! Only when you are truly satisfied, will you enjoy your journey on the other mountains to climb. Otherwise, you’ll always be looking on the sides and overlooking the majestic view your own journey has!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The calm IS the fire. Because that is the fire that brings ideas to execution. Thoughts to action. And tangents to tangibles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your self-talk determines your self-worth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not making a decision because you are scared of making the wrong decision? If you don’t move, you would’ve already made the wrong decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Movement brings momentum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being yourself in a world that is chasing a yo-yo-ed version of everyone else, is the ultimate reward. Money, success, worldly pleasures – everything follows the person who chooses to be who they are. Money, success, worldly pleasures – everything but happiness follows the person who follows inauthenticity to make others happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merely knowing what you need to do is not enough for you to do it! Awareness is the start of the decision. Not the end of it. Step 1 is Awareness. Step 2 is Execution. Step 3 is Rinse and Repeat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparing yourself to others is the biggest waste of time. Everyone had different beginnings. Different temperaments of parents. Totally different interests and hobbies. Different ways parents perceived success. Different teachers who taught you to fit in. And you expect yourself to outsmart someone else. It is an insult to your journey. And an insult to what all you have endured to get here. If you truly want to compare, compare yourself to who you were yesterday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We always have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>The easy one</li>
<li>The right one</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>We always have choices. No one’s ever stuck. We are just scared to make those choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safe is better than sorry. Nope. Risk is better than regret.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The past, however hard-working, shiny and glamorous it was, if it doesn’t hold relevance in your present, it makes zero sense to drag it into the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distance between ‘I could have’ and ‘I have’ is regret.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hardest thing in the world is telling yourself that it’s not hard at all. It is not hard to wake up early. It is not hard to make money. It is not hard to approach strangers. It is not hard to express love. It is not hard to send cold emails. It is not hard to ask for a raise. It is not hard to ask questions. It is not hard to voice your opinion. What’s hard is convincing your mind that it is not hard. That you can do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are scared of losing, you have already lost!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of worrying about what might happen, anticipate what might happen. Our power to imagine is both a strength and a weakness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are not the only one confused. You are not the only one unsure. You are not the only one struggling. You are not dumb, inadequate, incapable. Everyone is struggling. Everyone is figuring it out. Don’t be harsh on yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The greatest illusion is that life should be perfect! People who are enjoying their lives are at a competitive advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A meaningful job need not be one that completely consumes your whole life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you feel high without being high, If you are intoxicated by joy instead of substances, If you love to express yourself without numbing your senses, You are at a place of untouchable joy and peace. The only intake you need is more self-belief that you are just perfect as you are!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resisting the obvious is a great way to change your orbit. If you do what everyone else will do, you will end up like everyone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complaining has never ever led someone to a solution. Complaining amplifies the problem. It justifies why it exists. Makes us feel the victim, the person subject to the miseries created by the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working out teaches you discipline and patience like few other things do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gratitude. Not entitlement. How you treat someone who has nothing to offer defines your value system. Your values don’t help you grow. But in times of shit, they hold you together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will get what you seek. Not what you desire. Not what you dream. What you seek. Fervently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capability is rarely the question mark in life. It is always the intent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘If I can’t trust you, it doesn’t matter how smart you are.’ The best advice I have ever got!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not necessarily need to have a start-up in order to become an entrepreneur. You can start where you are. Move things that need to be moved. Change the status quo for the better. And you are an entrepreneur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘I trust you not because you know everything. I trust you because I know that you will do everything in your capacity to find the answer.’ This is what I tell my most capable team members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attitude &raquo; Experience &raquo; Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I asked my first boss, how come there was always this unequal distribution of work even within the same team, he replied, ‘Good people pay a far higher price for being good than bad people pay for being bad.’ He wasn’t talking about work. He was talking about life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideas are hardly new. What’s new is solving an unsolved problem in an existing idea. For that, you first need to learn what it is that others before you already know, that you don’t know as yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your idea is not your startup. Your approach is your startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A great leader should be replaceable when it comes to their tasks and actions. And irreplaceable when it comes to their thoughts and vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hope these reflections of mine help you, as much as they help me as well: Would you be friends with your own self? Would you marry yourself? Would you be your own boss? What version of you would you rather not be? Why do you still continue being that version?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding a grudge against someone requires a lot of effort. Think of all the wasted time spent being mad at someone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a big difference between saying thank you and feeling thankful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you learn anything, you make it a part of you. When you teach anything, you make it a part of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your kindness might cause you pain, a sense of betrayal, heartburn. Be kind anyway. Not everyone is going to reciprocate your kindness. Some are even going to play with it. Some are not going to care. Some are not going to acknowledge it ever. Yet, kindness is always the right thing to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sympathy: I feel sorry for you. Empathy: I can understand what you must be going through. Respect: I admire the way you are handling this. Respect &raquo; Empathy &raquo; Sympathy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run away from those who are trying to run away from themselves. Those who are not willing to heal themselves. Those who do not want to know their deeper parts. Those who are not okay and do nothing to change it. Those who do not want to have difficult conversations with themselves. Run away from those who never run towards themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect doesn’t come from the title. It comes from conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who are loved the most, are the ones who BELIEVE that they are worthy of love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don’t have to agree with each other as long as we understand each other. The best relationship doesn’t necessarily agree on everything. The best relationships have the best acceptance despite their differences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your true friends are those who are TRULY happy for you when you succeed. Be that true friend for others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wanting to maintain a distance from someone you do not relate to any more doesn’t mean you don’t care about them. It just means you care about the relationship you have with yourself more than the one you have with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not the average of the five people we spend the most time with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing matters more in life than showing up every day. To work, to assume responsibilities, to nurture relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never forget where you have come from.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Peace out.</p>
