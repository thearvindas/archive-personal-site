<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve documented everything going on in my life here, so here goes.
The start to 2022 has been very eventful so far and January has been a month of new learnings and experiences.</p>
<p>The biggest (and best) thing going on right now would have to be my internship at <a href="https://zuperly.com/" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Zuperly</a>
. Working with this fantastic team has been an amazing journey so far. Here&rsquo;s some of my highlights and takeaways from the ride so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>The people you work with is just as important as the work itself. I&rsquo;ve met some incredible people from different backgrounds and walks of life, but who all share one common passion and energy â€” to build an amazing product. These folks have become family, every meeting we have is a joy.</li>
<li>Being able to take up and prove ownership is an unmatched feeling. Despite being an intern, I&rsquo;ve been given full liberty on the projects I&rsquo;ve been working on and it&rsquo;s a great feeling knowing that the team trusts me to work on these things and my capability to deliver results. In fact, I&rsquo;ve never felt like an intern, here. I feel more like a part of the core team. Perhaps, that is the true fun of startups.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s the simplest things that require the most brainstorming. Something that looks seemingly obvious has hours and hours of brainstorming put into it. I do love the challenge, though, and what makes it even better is the privilege of getting to work on such problems with fantastic people like <a href="https://twitter.com/KapilReddyK11" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Kapil</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love this place and team and really could not be more grateful for the experience so far.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also started reading again. I&rsquo;ve had some difficulties picking up books, given my long phase of reading inaction over my high school and first few years of college. But realizing how important reading is and the kinds of learnings I was missing out on, it was inevitable that I gave it another shot. I&rsquo;ve read a couple of books so far this month, documented my learnings <a href="/tags/books/" 
  
  
>here</a>
.</p>
<p>Another really interesting thing I&rsquo;ve started again is learning German on Duolingo. You may ask &ldquo;why German?&rdquo; for which I&rsquo;ll tell you:</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is actually German; it means &ldquo;friend of the people&rdquo;</li>
<li>I like learning new things, it would be amazing to be able to converse in a new language</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, I did try learning this a year ago, but wasn&rsquo;t motivated to keep at it. This time around, I&rsquo;m very excited to keep learning, I&rsquo;ve also started making notes of everything I learn to help me remember better.</p>
<p>Something else I&rsquo;ve started as well is learning how to cook. I&rsquo;ve always had a keen interest in the art and I&rsquo;ve recently started spending a lot more time in the kitchen, experimenting around a little bit. Funnily enough, I can see myself, say 2 years down the line, being a really good cook. That&rsquo;s probably what inspires me to keep going.</p>
<p>This might seem like a month full of motivation to learn new things because of the &ldquo;new year, new me&rdquo; system, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like that, you know? The last few years of my life have been a lot about just exploring different things and trying to figure out what I&rsquo;m passionate about. It&rsquo;s been all over the place with no goals or dreams in mind. Now I feel like I&rsquo;m starting to figure things out. I like the direction I&rsquo;m headed in, I like the things I&rsquo;m doing. I feel some stability in terms of decision-making about the years ahead and my career. This gives me the space to do what I want to do and there&rsquo;s no better feeling than that.</p>
<p>Another very exciting thing I&rsquo;ve started doing is watching war films. Ever since I was a kid, I always had this awe for the courage and mindset soldiers have. Started watching a lot of war films (only the biographical ones) and my favourite (as you might have guessed from the title) is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2179136/" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>American Sniper</a>
. I think, in general, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of movies, but biographical ones, I really really do enjoy. Hit me up if you have any recommendations in mind!</p>
<p>I think this is it for this one. It&rsquo;s been a stellar month so far. Only onwards and upwards from here.</p>
<p>Peace out.</p>
