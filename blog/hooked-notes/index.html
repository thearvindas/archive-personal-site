>Hooked</a>
 by Nir Eyal:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Face it, we’re hooked. The technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions. It’s the impulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later. It’s the urge you likely feel throughout your day but hardly notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cognitive psychologists define habits as, “automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues:” things we do with little or no conscious thought. The products and services we use habitually alter our everyday behavior, just as their designers intended. Our actions have been engineered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, amassing millions of users is no longer good enough. Companies increasingly find that their economic value is a function of the strength of the habits they create. In order to win the loyalty of their users and create a product that’s regularly used, companies must learn not only what compels users to click, but also what makes them tick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions. A habit is at work when users feel a tad bored and instantly open Twitter. They feel a pang of loneliness and before rational thought occurs, they are scrolling through their Facebook feeds. A question comes to mind and before searching their brains, they query Google. The first-to-mind solution wins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do products create habits? The answer: They manufacture them. Today, small startup teams can profoundly change behavior by guiding users through a series of experiences I call “hooks.” The more often users run through these hooks, the more likely they are to form habits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These years of distilled research and real-world experience resulted in the creation of the Hook Model: a four-phase process companies use to forms habits.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trigger: A trigger is the actuator of behavior — the spark plug in the engine. Triggers come in two types: external and internal. [viii] Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an email, a website link, or the app icon on a phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action: Following the trigger comes the action: the behavior done in anticipation of a reward. Companies leverage two basic pulleys of human behavior to increase the likelihood of an action occurring: the ease of performing an action and the psychological motivation to do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variable Reward: Research shows that levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine surge when the brain is expecting a reward. Introducing variability multiplies the effect, creating a focused state, which suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason while activating the parts associated with wanting and desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investment: The investment phase increases the odds that the user will make another pass through the hook cycle in the future. The investment occurs when the user puts something into the product of service such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money. However, the investment phase isn’t about users opening up their wallets and moving on with their day. Rather, the investment implies an action that improves the service for the next go-around. Inviting friends, stating preferences, building virtual assets, and learning to use new features are all investments users make to improve their experience. These commitments can be leveraged to make the trigger more engaging, the action easier, and the reward more exciting with every pass through the hook cycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As famed Silicon Valley investor Paul Graham writes, “…unless the forms of technological progress that produced these things are subject to different laws than technological progress in general, the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hooks connect the user’s problem with a company’s solution frequently enough to form a habit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such is the nature of ingrained habits — behaviors done with little or no conscious thought — which by some estimates, guide nearly half of our daily actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Habits form when the brain takes a shortcut and stops actively deliberating over what to do next. The brain quickly learns to codify behaviors that provide a solution to whatever situation it encounters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Habit-forming products change user behavior and create unprompted user engagement. The aim is to influence customers to use your product on their own, again and again, without relying on overt calls-to-action such as ads or promotions. Once a habit is formed, the user is automatically triggered to use the product during routine events such as wanting to kill time while waiting in line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fostering consumer habits is an effective way to increase the value of a company by driving higher customer lifetime value (CLTV). CLTV is the amount of money made from a customer before she switches to a competitor, stops using the product, or dies. User habits increase how long and how frequently customers use a product, resulting in higher CLTV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, realized that as customers form routines around a product, they come to depend upon it and become less price-sensitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2011, Libin published a chart now known as the “smile graph.” With the percentage of sign-ups represented on the Y-axis and time spent on the service on the Xaxis, the chart showed that, although usage plummeted at first, it rocketed upward as people formed a habit of using the service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users who continually find value in a product are more likely to tell their friends about it. Frequent usage creates more opportunities to encourage people to invite their friends, broadcast content, and share through word-of mouth. Hooked users become brand evangelists — megaphones for your company, bringing in new users at little or no cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facebook’s success was, in part, a result of what I call the more is more principle — more frequent usage drives more viral growth. As tech-entrepreneur turned venture capitalist, David Skok points out, “The most important factor to increasing growth is … Viral Cycle Time.” Viral Cycle Time is the amount of time it takes a user to invite another user, and it can have a massive impact. “For example, after 20 days with a cycle time of two days, you will have 20,470 users,” Skok writes. “But if you halved that cycle time to one day, you would have over 20 million users! It is logical that it would be better to have more cycles occur, but it is less obvious just how much better.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A classic paper by John Gourville, a professor of marketing at Harvard Business School, stipulates that, “Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.” Gourville claims that for new entrants to stand a chance, they can’t just be better, they must be nine times better. Why such a high bar? Because old habits die hard and new products or services need to offer dramatic improvements to shake users out of old routines. Gourville writes that products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To borrow a term from accounting, behaviors are LIFO — “last in, first out.” In other words, the habits you’ve most recently acquired are also the ones most likely to go soonest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why haven’t more Google users switched to Bing? Habits keep users loyal. If a user is familiar with the Google interface, switching to Bing requires cognitive effort. Although many aspects of Bing are similar to Google, even a slight change in pixel placement forces the would-be user to learn a new way of interacting with the site. Adapting to the differences in the Bing interface is what actually slows down regular Google users and makes Bing feel inferior, not the technology itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A company can begin to determine its product’s habit-forming potential by plotting two factors: frequency (how often the behavior occurs) and perceived utility (how useful and rewarding the behavior is in the user’s mind over alternative solutions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A behavior that occurs with enough frequency and perceived utility enters the Habit Zone, helping to make it a default behavior. If either of these factors falls short and the behavior lies below the threshold, it is less likely that the desired behavior will become a habit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Are you building a vitamin or painkiller?” is a common, almost clichéd question many investors ask founders eager to cash their first venture capital check. The correct answer, from the perspective of most investors, is the latter: a painkiller. Likewise, innovators in companies big and small are constantly asked to prove their idea is important enough to merit the time and money needed to build it. Gatekeepers such as investors and managers want to invest in solving real problems — or, meeting immediate needs — by backing painkillers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My answer to the vitamin or painkiller question is that habit-forming technologies are both. These services seem, at first, to be offering nice-to-have vitamins, but once the habit is established, they provide an ongoing pain remedy. Habit-forming products often start as nice-to-haves (vitamins) but once the habit is formed, they become must-haves (painkillers).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trigger">trigger<a class="anchor" href="#trigger">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Habits are like pearls. Oysters create natural pearls by accumulating layer upon layer of a nacre called mother-of-pearl, eventually forming the smooth treasure over several years. But what causes the nacre to begin forming a
pearl? The arrival of a tiny irritant, such as a piece of grit or an unwelcome parasite, triggers the oyster’s system to begin blanketing the invader with layers of shimmery coating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A trigger is the actuator of behavior — the grit in the oyster that precipitates the pearl. Whether we are cognizant of them or not, triggers move us to take action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Habit-forming technologies start changing behavior by first cueing users with a call-to-action. This sensory stimuli is delivered through any number of things in our environment. External triggers are embedded with information, which tells the user what to do next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of External Triggers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Paid: Advertising, search engine marketing, and other paid channels are commonly used to get users’ attention and prompt them to act. Since paying for re-engagement is unsustainable for most business models, companies generally use paid triggers to acquire new users and then leverage other triggers to bring them back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earned: Earned triggers are free in that they can not be bought directly, but they often require investment in the form of time spent on public and media relations. Favorable press mentions, hot viral videos, and featured App Store placements are all effective ways to gain attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relationship: Relationship triggers can create the viral hypergrowth entrepreneurs and investors lust after. Sometimes relationship triggers drive growth because people love to tell each other about a wonderful offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Owned: Owned triggers consume a piece of real-estate in the user’s environment. They consistently show up in daily life and it is ultimately up to the user to opt into allowing these triggers to appear. For example, an app icon on the user’s phone screen, an email newsletter to which the user subscribes, or an app update notification only appear if the user wants it there. As long as the user agrees to receive a trigger, the company that sets the trigger owns a share of the user’s attention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While paid, earned, and relationship triggers drive new user acquisition, owned triggers prompt repeat engagement until a habit is formed. Without owned triggers and users’ tacit permission to enter their attentional space, it is difficult to cue users frequently enough to change their behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a product becomes tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a preexisting routine, it leverages an internal trigger. Unlike external triggers, which use sensory stimuli like a morning alarm clock or giant “Log-In Now” button, you can’t see, touch, or hear an internal trigger. Internal triggers manifest automatically in your mind. Connecting internal triggers with a product is the brass ring of consumer technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily routines. Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As product designers, it is our goal to solve these problems and eliminate pain — to scratch the user’s itch. Users who find a product that alleviates their pain will form strong, positive associations with the product over time. After continued use, bonds begin to form — like the layers of nacre in an oyster — between the product and the user whose need it satisfies. Gradually, these bonds cement into a habit as users turn to your product when experiencing certain internal triggers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once hooked, using these products does not always require an explicit call-to-action. Instead, they rely upon our automatic responses to feelings that precipitate the desired behavior. Products that attach to these internal triggers provide users with quick relief. Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Products that successfully create habits soothe the user’s pain by laying claim to a particular feeling. To do so, product designers must know their user’s internal triggers — that is, the pain they seek to solve. But finding customers’ internal triggers requires learning more about people than what they can tell you in a survey. It requires digging deeper to understand how your users feel. The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user’s pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company’s product or service as the source of relief.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="action">action<a class="anchor" href="#action">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The next step in The Hook is the action phase. The trigger, driven by internal or external cues, informs the user of what to do next; however, if the user does not take action, the trigger is useless. To initiate action, doing must be easier than thinking. Remember, a habit is a behavior done with little or no conscious thought. The more effort — either physical or mental — required to perform the desired action, the less likely it is to occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fogg posits that there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior. The Fogg Behavior Model is represented in a formula, B = MAT, which represents that a given behavior will occur when motivation, ability, and a trigger are present at the same time and in sufficient degrees. If any component of this formula is missing or inadequate, the user will not cross the “Action Line” and the behavior will not occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While a trigger cues an action, motivation defines the level of desire to take that action. Dr. Edward Deci, Professor of Psychology at the University of Rochester and a leading researcher on Self-Determination Theory, defines motivation as, “the energy for action.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As recent history of the web demonstrates, the ease or difficulty of doing a particular action impacts the likelihood that a behavior will occur. To successfully simplify a product, we must remove obstacles that stand in the user’s way. According to the Fogg Behavior Model, ability is the capacity to do a particular behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fogg describes six “elements of simplicity” — the factors that influence a task’s difficulty. [lxi] These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time - How long it takes to complete an action.</li>
<li>Money - The fiscal cost of taking an action.</li>
<li>Physical Effort - The amount of labor involved in taking the action.</li>
<li>Brain Cycles - The level of mental effort and focus required to take an action.</li>
<li>Social Deviance - How accepted the behavior is by others.</li>
<li>Non-Routine - According to Fogg, “How much the action matches or disrupts existing routines.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1975, researchers Worchel, Lee, and Adewole wanted to know how people would value cookies in two identical glass jars. One jar held ten cookies while the other contained just two stragglers. Which cookies would people value more? While the cookies and jars were identical, participants valued the ones in the near-empty jar more highly. The appearance of scarcity affected their perception of value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 2007 study attempted to measure if price had any influence on the taste of wine. The researchers had study participants sample wine while in an fMRI machine. As the machine scanned the blood flow in the various regions of their brains, the tasters were informed of the cost of each wine sampled. The sample started with a $5 wine and progressed to a $90 bottle. Interestingly, as the price of the wine increased, so did the participant’s enjoyment of the wine. Not only did they say they enjoyed the wine more but their brain corroborated their feelings, showing higher spikes in the regions associated with pleasure. Little did the study participants realize, they were tasting the same wine each time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two groups of customers were given punch cards awarding a free car wash once the cards were fully punched. One group was given a blank punch card with 8 squares and the other given a punch card with 10 squares but with two free punches. Both groups still had to purchase 8 car washes to receive a free wash; however, the second group of customers — those that were given two free punches — had a staggering 82 percent higher completion rate. The study demonstrates the endowed progress effect, a phenomenon that increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variable-reward">variable reward<a class="anchor" href="#variable-reward">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The third step in the Hook Model is the Variable Reward phase. In this phase, you reward your users by solving a problem, reinforcing their motivation for the action taken in the previous phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To hold our attention, products must have an ongoing degree of novelty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More recent experiments reveal that variability increases activity in the nucleus accumbens and spikes levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variable rewards can be found in all sorts of products and experiences that hold our attention. They fuel our drive to check email, browse the web, or bargain-shop. I propose that variable rewards come in three types: Tribe, hunt and self.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tribe: Our brains are adapted to seek rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included. Many of our institutions and industries are built around this need for social reinforcement. With every post, tweet, or pin, users anticipate social validation. Rewards of the tribe keep users coming back, wanting more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hunt: The search for resources defines the next type of variable reward — the rewards of hunt. The need to acquire physical objects, such as food and other supplies that aid our survival, is part of our brain’s operating system. But where we once hunted for food, today we hunt for other things. In modern society, food can be bought with cash, and more recently by extension, information translates into money. Rewards of the hunt existed long before the advent of computers. But today we find numerous examples of variable rewards associated with the pursuit of resources and information that compel us with the same determination as the San hunter chasing his prey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self: We are driven to conquer obstacles, even if just for the satisfaction of doing so. Pursuing a task to completion can influence people to continue all sorts of behaviors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="investment">investment<a class="anchor" href="#investment">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is one last step in the Hook Model that is critical for building habit-forming technologies. Before users create the mental associations that activate their automatic behaviors, they must first invest in the product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>University students in America were given instructions to assemble an origami crane or frog. After the exercise, students were asked to purchase their creation, bidding up to one dollar. Builders were informed that a random number between 0 and 100 would be drawn. If it exceeded their reservation price, the builders would return empty handed — but if it was equal to or less than the builder’s bid, they would pay their bid and keep the origami. Meanwhile, a separate group of students located in another room, unaware of the identity of the builders, were asked to bid on their origami using the same procedure. Similarly, a third independent group was asked to bid on expert-made origami under the same criteria. The results showed that those who made their own origami animals valued their creation five times higher than the second group’s valuation, and nearly as high as the expert-made origami values. In other words, those who invested labor associated greater value with their paper creations simply because they had worked on them. Ariely calls this the “IKEA effect.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also in contrast to the Action Phase, the Investment Phase increases friction. This certainly breaks conventional thinking in the product design community that all user experiences should be as “easy” (and effortless) as possible. This approach still generally holds true, as does my advice in the Action Phase to make the intended actions as simple as possible. In the Investment Phase, however, asking users to do a bit of work comes after users have received variable rewards, not before. The timing of asking for user investment is critically important. By asking for the investment after the reward, the company has an opportunity to leverage a central trait of human behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investments increase the likelihood of users returning by improving the service the more it is used. They enable the accrual of stored value in the form of content, data, followers, reputation or skill.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are now equipped to use the Hook Model to ask yourself these five fundamental questions for building effective hooks:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal Trigger)</li>
<li>What brings users to your service? (External Trigger)</li>
<li>What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action)</li>
<li>Are users fulfilled by the reward, yet left wanting more? (Variable Reward)</li>
<li>What “bit of work” do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use? (Investment)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s admit it, we are all in the persuasion business. Technologists build products meant to persuade people to do what we want them to do. We call these people “users” and even if we don’t say it aloud, we secretly wish every one of them would become fiendishly hooked to whatever we’re making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the increasing pervasiveness and persuasiveness of personal technology, some industry insiders have proposed creating an ethical code of conduct. Others believe differently: Chris Nodder, author of the book Evil by Design, writes “… it’s OK to deceive people if it’s in their best interests, or if they’ve given implicit consent to be deceived as part of a persuasive strategy.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I offer a simple decision support tool entrepreneurs, employees, and investors can use long before product is shipped or code is written. The Manipulation Matrix does not try to answer which businesses are moral or which will succeed, nor does it describe what can and can not become a habit-forming technology. The matrix seeks to help you answer not, “Can I hook my users?” but instead, “Should I attempt to?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To use the Manipulation Matrix, the maker needs to ask two questions. First, “Would I use the product myself?” and second, “Will the product help users materially improve their lives?”</p>
<ul>
<li>materially improves the user&rsquo;s life + maker uses it = facilitator</li>
