<p>Sixth sem has been absolute madness. Hear me out.</p>
<p>March 10th was the last time I wrote something for this blog. It&rsquo;s crazy how fast time has gone by.
I have my final exams going on right now (I should definitely be studying Heat Transfer at this very moment) but I decided I&rsquo;ll put out some time to update my life, as I&rsquo;ve done so far, over here.
(I genuinely wonder if people read this, and if they do, what goes through their heads when they read my thoughts. If you&rsquo;re reading this, I would <em>love</em> to talk with you and understand. Please hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/thearvindas" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Twitter</a>
 =P)</p>
<p>This sem has been incredibly hectic and challenging. Shifting back to an offline mode of college has been pretty taxing, add to that regular assignments, exams, and labs — so very tiring. While I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful that we could come back to campus, I can&rsquo;t wait for this sem to end, I do need a break.</p>
<p>From automobiles to thermodynamics to marketing to first aid, I&rsquo;ve learnt so much this semester. Along with college, I&rsquo;ve been working at Zuperly as well. Incredible to think of the progress we&rsquo;ve made as a team and the product we&rsquo;ve built from scratch over the last few months. I wrap up my internship this week, but so much gratitude for the learnings and the opportunities I&rsquo;ve got here. This has truly kickstarted the journey for me. Thank you so much Kapil and team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to let you know that a month ago, my sister had her Bharatnatyam arangetram. So proud of what she&rsquo;s achieved over the last 10 years. She&rsquo;s had so many ups and downs but she&rsquo;s never given up, what a performer, what an inspiration, and what a reminder to persist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also so excited to tell you that I finished my third 10K run! Oh man, this was really such a push, I&rsquo;ve been working out quite a bit, but this run had me on the edge. Especially towards the end, the track had immense elevation changes, absolute death towards the final few kilometres. So so happy I kept pushing, there&rsquo;s NO other feeling like crossing the finish line after working so hard. I&rsquo;m confident I can reach 21K very soon. Just need to put in the effort. I think, more than effort, need to put in the time. Running long distances takes a lot of time, just can&rsquo;t seem to find enough of it with so much on my plate. I know what I&rsquo;ll be doing this summer.</p>
<p>I have just a year of engineering left. We&rsquo;re done. So close to the end. It&rsquo;s almost crazy to think about. I&rsquo;m really happy though. This phase of life has been a tremendous learning experience. Now we really need to figure things out. I might have to move out of the hostels next so I need to figure out how to rent an apartment. I need to get an internship in my 8th semester. And I need to figure out where I&rsquo;m taking my career after college. We&rsquo;ll get it done though.</p>
<p>One year ago, at this time, I was nowhere. I had no vision of what I wanted to be, I had no goals. I can say I&rsquo;ve come a long way. I don&rsquo;t know what the future holds in store, but I can&rsquo;t wait to learn and grow more. So much more to come, I really can&rsquo;t wait. Here&rsquo;s to more effort, more pushing, and reaching those heights.</p>
<p>The sky is <em>not</em> the limit.</p>
<p>Peace out.</p>
