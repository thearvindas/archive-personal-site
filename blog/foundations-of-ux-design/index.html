<p><small> I&rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of design. The moment I got some free time, I made sure to make the most out of it â€” I took <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>this course</a>
 and wrote down what I found most important so as to document my learnings as well as, maybe, pass it on.<br>
<strong>Here&rsquo;s what I learnt.</strong> </small></p>
<p><b> What is UX? </b><br>
UX stands for User Experience. It is how a user feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.</p>
<p><b> What&rsquo;s a product? </b><br>
A product is a good, service, or feature. Nearly everything is a product â€” your watch, your pizza, your book, and even this website.</p>
<p><b> What is good UX? </b><br>
A good UX is the experience a user has if a product is <strong>useable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful</strong>. Hold up. That&rsquo;s a lot of terms. Let&rsquo;s break it down further using the Amazon app to understand better:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Useable</strong>: a product needs to have a clear design, structure, and purpose. It should be user-friendly. Customer care shouldn&rsquo;t be handling calls where users complain that they couldn&rsquo;t find how to remove an item from cart</li>
<li><strong>Equitable</strong>: a product needs to be able to cater to a variety of users with diverse abilities and backgrounds. If a UXd. (UX Designer) at Amazon ships the app with no native language support to an Indian audience, the userbase is limited right away to people who understand English</li>
<li><strong>Enjoyable</strong>: a product must provide an excellent experience to a user. A UXd. should make sure no user feels frustrated, anxious, or confused when using the app.</li>
<li><strong>Useful</strong>: a product needs to be able to serve the purpose for which it has been made. If a user is browsing Amazon but unable to add anything to cart and buy things, that user is not going to use this app anymore</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why does good UX matter?</b><br>
Research says that businesses that focus on good usability and design outperform the competition by miles. Think of it this way â€” when do you recommend a product to a friend? Only when you have a good experience using it.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The design is not just what it looks like and feels like. The design is how it works.&rdquo; â€” Steve Jobs</em></p>
<p><b>The Product Development Lifecycle</b><br>
Every product follows a series of steps before it is launched. This is called the <em>Product Development Lifecycle</em>, and it has five stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>brainstorm</strong>: what is the issue/problem we want to solve</li>
<li><strong>define</strong>: whom is this for, what will it do, what features should it have</li>
<li><strong>design</strong>: how will it work, how does it look, what kind of an experience will it provide a user</li>
<li><strong>test</strong>: how does this fare with test users, how can we improve upon the initial version using test phase feedback</li>
<li><strong>launch</strong>:  ðŸš€</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re UXds, our primary focus is the design phase. We need to design for a good user experience. Consider a food delivery app. We&rsquo;re hungry; we open our trusty old app. We find the perfect pizza. We add it to cart. We&rsquo;re ready to pay&hellip;only to find out that the restaurant isn&rsquo;t delivering today. <em>Yuck</em>. Bad UX. Let&rsquo;s not do that.</p>
<p><b> UX Design Frameworks</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User-Centered Design</strong>: understand, specify, design, and evaluate; understand how the user experiences the product, identify the end-user&rsquo;s needs, design solutions to the problem, assess if the design meets the end-user&rsquo;s wants</li>
<li><strong>Five Elements of Design</strong>: strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface; define the user&rsquo;s needs, determine what you&rsquo;re building, organize your design, make the layout, show the final product to the user</li>
<li><strong>Design Thinking</strong>: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test; discovering what the end-users need, defining the problem statement, brainstorm solutions, make prototypes, test with users and take in feedback to improve subsequent iterations</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What is a11y?</b><br>
a11y stands for accessibility. It refers to the design of products for everyone. A specially-abled person should not be unable to use a product. Common accessibility features include text-to-speech, closed-captioning, and enlarged font. In short, <em>build for everyone</em>. Designing for accessibility isn&rsquo;t an obstacle but a way to get our products to as many users as possible. Equity-focused design is a way to design for a11y. It means designing the product to be accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilities.</p>
<p><b>What is the NBU?</b><br>
NBU stands for <em>Next Billion Users</em>. There are currently nearly a billion people who are just starting and learning to use the internet. We need to understand the gap in digital literacy when designing products for the NBU. Our goal is to make every user feel like we designed the experience just for them, no matter who they are, where they live, how much they earn, or how highly they&rsquo;re educated. Most of the NBU will be using mobile platforms as they step into the internet world. Hence, UXds need to design products keeping the limitations of mobile devices in mind (screen real-estate, RAM, connectivity, size). Designing for multiple platforms is always better than &ldquo;hard-coding&rdquo; a design for a specific one.</p>
<p><b>Designing for Multiple Platforms</b><br>
When designing for multiple platforms, it is important to keep 4 &ldquo;C&quot;s in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: stay consistent with brand identity, visual appearance, and the voice of the company across all platforms</li>
<li><strong>Continuity</strong>: make sure users can maintain progress/carry on seamlessly when switching from one platform to another</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: think about when and how users will prefer to use a specific platform; for example, a user won&rsquo;t write a huge email on their smartwatches but would like to receive notifications about new emails or replies</li>
<li><strong>Complementary</strong>: add great value to the user&rsquo;s experience, make them come back for more</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What is a Design Sprint?</b><br>
A design sprint is a time-bound designing process with the goal of solving a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. Sprints prioritize the user by putting the sole focus on the UX of the final product. It saves time and creates a dynamic environment where creativity and high energy can be focused on building great output. Sprints, additionally, value every person in the room, leading to the best ideas coming out.
Design sprints majorly consist of five phases â€” understand, ideate, decide, prototype and test.
With proper planning, execution, and reflection, a design sprint is one of the best ways to bring out the true potential of a team.</p>
