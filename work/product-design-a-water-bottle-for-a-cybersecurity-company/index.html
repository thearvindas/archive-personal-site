<p>This is my take on the following prompt:</p>
<p><img src="/design-prompt-1.png" alt="prompt"></p>
<p>We are required to design a branded water bottle for a cybersecurity company.
First, <strong>let&rsquo;s understand why we are designing this product</strong> (apart from the most generic reason: for employees to drink water from =] )</p>
<ul>
<li>People love brand merch, especially when it&rsquo;s their own company. It promotes a sense of loyalty to the company, team spirit, and makes them feel like they&rsquo;re a part of the bigger picture (a company has made it big when its employees want to flaunt company swag)</li>
<li>Most of our employees sit at a desk all day long — it&rsquo;s important to stay hydrated</li>
<li>Zero-effort marketing — you see an employee drinking from a branded water bottle in the metro, you are made aware of this super cool xyz company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know why we&rsquo;re designing this product, <strong>let&rsquo;s start thinking of the users</strong>.
Here are 3 user personas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Meet Jeff, a software engineer at this company. He&rsquo;s recently graduated from college and joined us. He loves dogs, music, and playing football with his friends every weekend.</li>
<li>Meet Sarah, a senior product manager at this company. She joined the company two years ago and has been climbing up the ladder since. She&rsquo;s a mother of two and a great baker.</li>
<li>Meet Sally, the CEO of this company. She built the company from scratch 6 years ago and has never taken a day off. When she&rsquo;s not in endless Zoom meetings or workshops, you&rsquo;ll find her at her foundation for women in tech.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at the user personas, it&rsquo;s evident that all of our users spend a lot of time at work, perhaps at their desks. They lead busy, engaging lives and hence, it&rsquo;s very important to stay hydrated. The kind of life this water bottle would have is, it would be filled up in the morning, taken to work, put on the desk, used throughout the day, maybe filled up once or twice during the day, taken home, cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, <strong>we can figure out the features the bottle can have</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>since it&rsquo;ll be seeing everyday use, it has to be made up of a durable, long-lasting material</li>
<li>it&rsquo;ll be on the desk for most of the time, since it&rsquo;ll be in proximity of electronics and laptops, the bottle will have to be leak-proof, non-spill, probably with a sipper style output</li>
<li>we need to put our brand on it, hence the material has to be of brand colors, with our logo embossed on it</li>
<li>to encourage users to stay hydrated, we can have a geeky quote on the outside that motivates them to drink water</li>
<li>ergonomic grip so that users can take sips with one hand, if need be</li>
<li>lightweight, since it&rsquo;ll be carried to and from work everyday</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have a bunch of possible features, <strong>let&rsquo;s prioritize</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>We definitely need our brand colors and logo on the bottle, it increases the value of the bottle exponentially for our specific use case</li>
<li>Knowing where this bottle will be and how it&rsquo;ll mainly be used, designing it leak-proof, non-spill, with an ergonomic grip, and with a sipper output is key</li>
<li>Keeping it lightweight would be a great add for usability</li>
<li>Durable material is definitely a good add, but not a leading decisive factor. If we get this within the budget we have, let&rsquo;s go for it, if not, then we can pass</li>
<li>Having a nice quote on the outside is simply an extra feature, definitely not needed in our MVP. If we think it&rsquo;ll take away from a minimal design with focus on the company, we can do without it</li>
</ol>
<p>We have now figured out what features we&rsquo;ll be needing for our water bottle, we&rsquo;ve mapped them to user stories to solve pain points, and we&rsquo;ve created great company merch that our employees can stay hydrated with and also show-off to their friends and family =)</p>
