      <description>This is my take on the following prompt:
We are required to design a branded water bottle for a cybersecurity company. First, let&amp;rsquo;s understand why we are designing this product (apart from the most generic reason: for employees to drink water from =] )
 People love brand merch, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s their own company. It promotes a sense of loyalty to the company, team spirit, and makes them feel like they&amp;rsquo;re a part of the bigger picture (a company has made it big when its employees want to flaunt company swag) Most of our employees sit at a desk all day long — it&amp;rsquo;s important to stay hydrated Zero-effort marketing — you see an employee drinking from a branded water bottle in the metro, you are made aware of this super cool xyz company.</description>

      <description>Photo by Dan Gold on UnsplashThis is my attempt at a root-cause analysis on the following problem statement:
Uber&amp;rsquo;s rides from RGIA have dropped by 50% over the last week. Diagnose the problem.
50% is a massive number. Our first check will be on the metrics:
 Are we getting the correct metrics on our dashboard? Is there any technical hitch which may be causing incorrect data to appear?</description>
