      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been studying how much of an impact design plays in our lives. Be it the apps we use, the goods we pick up at the supermarket, or listening to music on our headphones—good design is what paves for a good experience. Design is, inherently, what makes a product or a service worth coming back to.
In the Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman says, &amp;ldquo;Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible.</description>

      <description>The more I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring the world of design, the more I&amp;rsquo;ve realized the immense power of Figma. Naturally, I had to get my hands dirty right away.
I play around with Adobe Ps and Ai quite often, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t take too much time to get going with Figma. I was immediately amazed by the brilliant workflow, tools, and simply the experience of using it. I watched a few YouTube videos to understand how things work.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of design. The moment I got some free time, I made sure to make the most out of it — I took this course on Coursera and wrote down what I found most important so as to document my learnings as well as, maybe, pass it on =)
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learnt. 
 What is UX? 
UX stands for User Experience. It is how a user feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.</description>

 My growing desire to build something A need for a platform to put my thoughts and learnings out Inspiration from Manan Agarwal , a senior of mine at college  My plans for this place are simple: to keep adding posts about what I learn and hopefully, add some value to anyone interested in design!</description>

      <description>“The more I live, the more I learn. The more I learn, the more I realize, the less I know.” – Michel Legrand
I&amp;rsquo;m Arvin Das, a 19 yo currently living in Hyderabad, India. By day, I&amp;rsquo;m a third year Mechatronics undergrad at MIT, Manipal. By night, I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for great design, minimalism, productivity and growth. On my weekends, you&amp;rsquo;ll find me rooting for Red Bull Racing.
Since the start of 2021, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a deep interest in building products.</description>
