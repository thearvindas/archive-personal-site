      <description>It’s been a couple of days since I’ve started out on Dribbble, and I must say, it’s been an exciting experience. It’s incredible to see so much creativity, ideas, mockups, everything-cool-about-design all in one place.
Seeing everyone’s work, I decided I needed something to show for as well; hence, I began making mini-projects. I’ve made two so far, really proud of how they’ve come out!

      <description>The more I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring the world of design, the more I&amp;rsquo;ve realized the immense power of Figma. Naturally, I had to get my hands dirty right away.
I play around with Adobe Ps and Ai quite often, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t take too much time to get going with Figma. I was immediately amazed by the brilliant workflow, tools, and simply the experience of using it. I watched a few YouTube videos to understand how things work.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of design. The moment I got some free time, I made sure to make the most out of it — I took this course on Coursera and wrote down what I found most important so as to document my learnings as well as, maybe, pass it on =)
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learnt. 
 What is UX? 
UX stands for User Experience. It is how a user feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.</description>

      <description>Hello! Welcome to my website! This website is the result of a couple of things:
 My growing desire to build something A need for a platform to put my thoughts and learnings out Inspiration from Manan Agarwal , a senior of mine at college  My plans for this place are simple: to keep adding posts about what I learn and hopefully, add some value to anyone interested in design!</description>

      <description>“The more I live, the more I learn. The more I learn, the more I realize, the less I know.” – Michel Legrand
I&amp;rsquo;m Arvin Das, a 20 yo currently living in Hyderabad, India. By day, I&amp;rsquo;m a third year Mechatronics undergrad at MIT, Manipal. By night, I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for great design, minimalism, productivity and growth. On the weekends, you&amp;rsquo;ll find me rooting for Red Bull Racing.
Since the start of 2021, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a deep interest in building products.</description>
