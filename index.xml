      <title>rules, why I need them, and why I&#39;m writing them down</title>

      <description>A while ago, I stumbled across Aditya Mohanty&amp;rsquo;s blog and saw this — a collection of rules that he lives by. Being someone that loves defining every aspect of my life and committing to a certain standard of ethics, I decided to make a list of rules for myself as well.
To save your time, I&amp;rsquo;ve listed my rules first, the chit-chat comes later.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been an ardent fan of trusting the process. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get disheartened when things don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work out but it&amp;rsquo;s important to believe that everyone has a story, a process, a journey towards what they want to achieve — trust it and never stop the hard work.
Yesterday came the good news of me clearing Upraised&amp;rsquo;s internship program called Embark . I was selected as one of the top 50 in the Design track among a total of 4.</description>

      <description>These are my notes from Solving Product Design Exercises by Artiom Dashinsky .
approaching a product design exercise Whenever you encounter a problem, don&amp;rsquo;t immediately dive into it and start thinking of solutions. The single most important thing to remember while solving product design exercises is to follow a process. Here are three tips to help you solve a problem:
  Make sure you understand the task: understand the deliverables, mode of delivery, fidelity level required, and the mode of presentation</description>

      <description>I leave home for college tomorrow. Lots of emotions running around in my head. Thought I&amp;rsquo;d document a bit of it.
The pandemic changed the way college works. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time at home than in Manipal so far in my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s. The norm has shifted. Home is where I live, Manipal is the vacation. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult for my family to see me packing my bags and looking up flights online.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going down for walks these days and have picked up a habit of listening to podcasts. Today I listened to this podcast by Rob Dial where he speaks about 6 habits to boost one&amp;rsquo;s productivity. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learnt:
Everyone has 24 hours in a day. The difference is in how these 24 hours are spent. To be productive is to maximize outcomes in the time we have — getting more things done in the same amount of time.</description>

      <description>Recently watched this video of Shreyas Doshi talking about his PM learnings over the years, and immediately knew I had to document it right away.
Here are my notes from the video:
Advice for aspiring PMs:
 Do the role before you get the job Your current company/work is the best place to start Build your own side project/product  The Law of PM Suitability: the traits required to break into the PM role are the very same traits that are prerequisites for succeeding as a PM</description>

      <description>Before I begin, here are a few things I&amp;rsquo;d like to clear up:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing that the titles of these blog posts have been increasing in length each time. Although I would like them all to be the same length simply for good visuals, I can&amp;rsquo;t find a way to keep them concise. Hence, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking at the list of posts and noticing the gradual increase, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s been bothering me too.</description>

      <description>At the start of 2021, I promised myself I&amp;rsquo;d do a few things for sure this year. Excited to tell y&amp;rsquo;all that I&amp;rsquo;ve ticked off a checkbox—sending a cold email. I was hesitant to apply for internships over the last few months due to a fear of a lack of knowledge. I can now tell you in all honesty that, that is time gone down the drain. No regrets because I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a lot, nevertheless.</description>

      <description>inconvenient truth about productsproduct discovery--The more I dive into learning and understanding product, the more I understand how important reading is. I&amp;rsquo;ve come across some incredible reads in the past week, some of which I&amp;rsquo;d like to put out here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve said incredible reads, I&amp;rsquo;m sure some of y&amp;rsquo;all must be thinking, &amp;ldquo;oh, Arvin read something by Marty Cagan &amp;rdquo;. Damn right you are.
This article titled The Inconvenient Truth About Product speaks about the unavoidable, annoying, yet very real truth about building product.</description>

      <description>One of the cool things I did this summer was stepping into design (properly). I&amp;rsquo;ve always been intrigued by good visuals — I&amp;rsquo;ve been making art ever since I was a kid. Starting off with crayons to learning watercolours to being formally trained as an artist to creating graphics and digital art at college, I&amp;rsquo;ve had quite the ride.
Taking the Google UX Design course was a great learning experience. Obviously, MOOCs aren&amp;rsquo;t the best way to upskill these days, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things I learnt, some which changed the way I think about products and their design.</description>

      <description>The Olympics have come to an end and what an incredible few weeks it has been. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved sports. I started playing football for my neighbourhood team—Yellowbird Soccer—when I was 7. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, we didn&amp;rsquo;t win too much, but some of my fondest memories growing up are with this team. My dad was one of the coaches, and I vividly remember how we used to go to the ground early, lugging a bag with around 15 footballs, carrying marking cones and snacks for the team in a portable freezer.</description>

      <description>Hello!insert drumroll, perhaps some applause
(Just kidding.)
I am so, so pumped to be writing the first blog for my website. Building something of my own has always been this huge goal of mine and to see thearvindas.me come to life is unreal to me.
The process started way back at the start of June. I started looking up static site generators and, needless to say, I was very flustered by the endless resources and results.</description>

      <description>“The more I live, the more I learn. The more I learn, the more I realize, the less I know.” – Michel Legrand
I&amp;rsquo;m Arvin, a 20 y/o currently living in Hyderabad, India. By day, I&amp;rsquo;m a Mechatronics undergrad at MIT Manipal. By night, I love learning about building great product, sleek design and understanding how to hack into mental aesthetics.
I&amp;rsquo;d love to connect with you on Twitter or LinkedIn !</description>
